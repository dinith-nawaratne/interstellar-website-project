<h2>Joseph Cooper<em>, </em>(<em>"Cooper"</em>)</h2>
<p>"Cooper is the protagonist of the film. His primary motivation is to exist (from a deep and meaningful place) and to explore. He's a widower and former NASA pilot who has been grounded and now lives as a farmer, raising crops in a world where the food supply is running out. While he loves his children, and believes in what he is doing on the farm, we can see that he yearns for more from life. We also begin to understand, in him, the emotional journey of someone who's had their dreams and love in the palm of their hands, only to have them taken away prematurely. When the time comes to choose to stay on the farm or accept the mission to space, he goes, and in doing so carries us, the audience, through a journey to discover what it means to love and be loved, and how to do what is right and necessary to save yourself and others."</p>

<h2>Murphy Cooper, (<em>"Murph"</em>)</h2>
<p>"Murph is Cooper's daughter. She is incredibly bright and enjoys learning (as evidenced by the massive bookshelf in her room). Her curiosity and passion for science are cultivated by her father's encouragement throughout her youth. When Cooper chooses to accept his role in NASA's mission through the wormhole, Murph is devastated, believing that she may never see her father again. She considers his departure a monstrous betrayal and finds herself unable to contact him until well into adulthood.</p>
<p>As she grows older, Murph finds motivation through her anger toward her father and the desolate state of the planet. Once she gets beyond that anger, it's her love for Cooper that helps her understand why he chose to go, and in turn allows him to help her solve the gravitational equation that will save Earth."</p>

<h2>Professor John Brand</h2>
<p>"A former teacher of Cooper's and a leader at NASA, Professor Brand has spent decades attempting to solve the equation of gravity. Though his intentions seem clear when he describes Plans A and B to Cooper, he refuses to reveal that he actually stopped working on the equation long ago when he realized he would be unable to solve it without seeing inside a black hole. He believes that the people of Earth, including Cooper and his various NASA workers, will only be motivated to save humanity if they think their individual survival is possible, and so he falsely convinces everyone that Plan A is a viable option. His story is one of great inner conflict, as he wrestles with the impossibility of Plan A while also trying to put the species' interests before any one individual's."</p>

Brand had a love affair with Dr. Wolf Edmunds before his departure on the Lazarus missions, and struggles to remove this factor from her decision-making aboard the Endurance. She becomes the first colonizer of humanity's new planet when she reaches Edmunds' planet alone and establishes a settlement."</p>

<h2>Professor Romilly</h2>
<p>"A NASA astronaut on mission with Cooper, Romilly is intelligent, sensitive, and vulnerable. Despite his undeniable bravery, he struggles with the spinning of the Endurance and the daunting awareness that only a thin metal wall separates him from the infinite vacuum of space. During discussions of how to proceed with the mission, he acts as a calm voice of reason.</p>
<p>Romilly is arguably the film's most tragic character, as he endures 23 lonely years aboard the Endurance while Cooper and the others spend mere hours escaping Miller's planet. They return to find him time-worn and fragile, a smarter, wiser, but more delicate shell of himself. He is then senselessly killed by Dr. Mann's booby trap, turning his decades of solitude into an utter waste."</p>
